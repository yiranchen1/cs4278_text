<br />I think that based on the fact that students want to get more information about the courses and they are tired
of checking whether a course has empty space several times a day online, I want to design a software that could
test students about the course information when they are allowed to choose course.
<br />When students are allowed to choose courses, they will receive a text message giving them a list of recommended
courses based on their years and previous courses. Thus, students can use that information along with the adviceds
from their advisors/parents/friends to find the courses that they fit most.
<br />On the Vanderbilt's course selection system, students can mark a now fully filled course as "Interested".
Thus, whenever that course has available empty spaces, students will receive a text message about that. In this
way, students do not have to check course avalability online several times a day.
